<H2ThemeWrapper>Synopsis</H2ThemeWrapper>

This organization must determine and sort promotions every year for multiple ranks. These promotions are determined by a high-ranking board which reviews nominated candidates and filters and sorts them as they are rated. Initially, this application was developed in SilverLight, a technology which would no longer by supported by Microsoft after a certain date.

The following UX steps were undertaken for this effort:

* Defining the project and scope
* Researching current and future use
* Analysis and Planning
* Designing
* Prototyping
* User Testing
